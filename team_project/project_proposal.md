4.1 Project Proposal
Due: 9/24
The project proposal is worth 10% of the project grade.
You should come to class with a document that describes the main idea of your project. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team, so we ask that you come to the meeting without your laptop, but with a printed version of your document. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.
You should push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. I recommend you use markdown format for this proposal. Your proposal should contain the seven sections listed below. We don't expect this proposal to be very long, but the more detail you provide here the better help and feedback when can provide your team:

1 - The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

One of the main problems we all face as college students or amature cooks is deciding what to eat. While we manage to get most of the equipment used for cooking we are still left wondering what to make with the stuff in our refrigerators. That is the problem we are trying to solve with our application.  The idea of the project is for the application/website to offer recipes based on the ingredients you have in your pantry. We still have not decided if we want to pursue a website or an application. We will figure that out once our core program is ready. Our minimum viable goal is to make an application that can offer you breakfast recipes. Stretch goal is to offer more variety in terms of cultural breakfasts or complementary products. Furthermore, if viable we would like the function to work backwards wherein the program can guide the user’s grocery buying decision. The major topic that we would explore through this project in terms of course content would be I/O programming in addition to the basics covered in early classes. 
 
2 -Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

We wish to learn about the level of influence of certain user inputs on determining a result. 
We wish to learn how effective python is in building predictive models
We wish to expand our knowledge on what recipes/dish we can make with all the groceries we buy. 

3 - Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

We will scout the internet for data. We will add the input functionality to the program which will help determine the key results we are looking for. 

4 - Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

5 - Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
	
    We plan on communicating with Slack and Facebook Messenger throughout the project to ensure that all of our decisions are made collectively. Other than that we still have our GitHub database as well as a google drive to share documents in. We don’t wanna make a single person do all the coding so similarly to the pair programming sessions in class we will all get together to work on the major coding. This way everyone is included in the project and it becomes a collective effort instead of a single person doing most of the work. For the workstreams, we are planning on using an agile development method that allows each member to work on things they desire either alone or with the team and then collectively get feedback on the progress as a team. This way everyone is involved in the process and can also work in flexible hours because unfortunately not everyone is in the same time zone. We also considered working in a waterfall method but that seemed a little more challenging since it didn’t give us the flexibility we required. Overall, it is important for us to work together on this project and we feel like the structure we set will help us accomplish this goal.

6 - Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

The biggest risk associated with our project is determining the right amount of recipes to reference using our model. We do not want the number of recipes to be too large because of the sheer complexity that this would entail, but we also do not want the number of recipes to be too small because we do not want our model to be giving the same recipes over and over again. 

7 - Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

Learning the basics of HTML coding for creating a better website would be important for us since most of us aren’t very familiar with creating one. Another thing is learning how to link databases to python so our idea can work effectively.
